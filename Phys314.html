<h1>Phys314 &mdash; Quantum Mechanics II</h1>
<br>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Purpose of this course</h3>

<p> In this second semester of Quantum Mechanics we will broaden our
understanding of the theory, considering techniques that
can lead us to approximate solutions of more complicated 
systems. Application of quantum formalism to descriptions of atomic
systems, solid state systems, nuclei and other subatomic particles
will be presented.  </p>


<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Class Schedule</h3>
 <p>Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9.30am &mdash; 10.50am in Small Hall 233.</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<p>Fridays 1.30pm  &mdash; 3.00pm in Small Hall 328C.</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Lecture Notes</h3>
<p>I’ll post the lecture notes i'm working from on this website as we go along. Hopefully this means you can do less writing and be a bit more focussed during lecture time. Please let me know of any errors you spot in the notes.</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Problem Sets</h3>
<p>There will be regular problem sets on the material we cover in
lectures. These are a very important part of the course, almost
certainly more important than listening to your lecturer waffle
on. Sitting through lectures may make you <i>feel</i> like you have
learned something, but you don’t really know until you try to use the
techniques you think you have learned. The only way to become
comfortable with the tools is through practice.</p>


<p>I intend the problem sets to be pedagogic, and in some cases will
fill in important topics that we don't have time to cover in
lectures. There will be one problem set roughly every week, with a few
gaps.</p>


<p>I would strongly suggest that you should work on the problems first
<i>on your own</i>, but if you remain stuck you can confer with your peers or
get help from me.
I furthermore would strongly suggest that you use search engines or AI
tools as <i>a last resort</i> only after you've exhausted your own efforts,
conferred with your peers, and asked me for help &mdash; the experience of
finding your way to a solution is a powerful learning process, and
shortcutting it can cost you in the long-term. In addition (as with
any purported solution to a problem) you should check carefully that
any AI-generated answer makes sense. </p>

<p>Anything you present in a solution must reflect <i>your</i>
understanding at a level where if I asked you to explain it to me on
the blackboard, you would be able to. Simply copying someone else's
solution without understanding it would not meet this bar, and will be
considered to be cheating.</p>

<p>Because I will (try to) provide solutions promptly (to help you understand
anything you might have missed while the problems are still fresh in
your mind), significant extensions to problem set deadlines will not
be possible. If you need a short extension of a few hours, you may
request it in advance of the deadline. Large-scale unexpected
incidents can be handled individually, please get in touch by email
and we will arrange some accommodation.</p>


<p>The problem sets and deadlines will be posted below.</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Exams</h3>
 <p>There will be a midterm exam (in class on March 5th) and a final exam (to be scheduled).</p>



<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>We'll largely follow Griffiths  &amp; Schroeter <i>Introduction to Quantum
Mechanics</i> (Third Edition) which serves as a recommended text for this
class. There are many good Quantum Mechanics books out there targeted at the
undergraduate and graduate levels. Some that I am familiar with, which
you might be interested in looking at, are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gasiorowicz <i>Quantum Physics</i>. A nice compact book aimed at
  undergraduates, with clear notation and good problems. Was my
  preference when I was learning QM for the first time.</li>

  <li>Tong <i>Quantum Mechanics. Lectures on Theoretical
  Physics, Volume 3</i>. David Tong is a master of pedagogic
  presentation, and explains many things books often skip over. Based
  on lectures given to students in a mathematics department, but
  doesn't assume a great deal of advanced math skill. The only book in
  this list which has a decent discussion of foundations of quantum
  mechanics and quantum computing, covering topics like entanglement,
  measurement and decoherence, which are slightly beyond the scope of
  this class.</li>
  
  <li>Feynman <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics Volume
  III</i>. Designed to be taught to undergraduate freshmen! Not formal
  at all, assumes very little mathematics. Beautifully written, and
  fun to read, but not really a textbook in the usual sense of the
  word.</li>
  
  
  <li>Sakurai <i>Modern Quantum Mechanics</i>. Newer editions have
  been updated by Jim Napolitano. Aimed at graduate students, but
  gentle enough for undergrads if your math is reasonably strong.</li>
  
  <li>Gottfried &amp; Yan <i>Quantum Mechanics:
  Fundamentals</i>. Definitely designed for graduate students, assumes
  strong math skills, gets through the basic material quite quickly,
  more formal in some places, but quite a few nice applications.</li>
  
</ul>

<p>There are <i>many</i> other textbooks out there, i'm just less
familiar with them. Make sure you have access to at least one that
you're comfortable with. There might be minor notational differences
with respect to the lectures, but that's something we all have to get
used to anyway.</p>
