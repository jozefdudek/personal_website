<h1>Phys314 &mdash; Quantum Mechanics II</h1>
<br>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Purpose of this course</h3>

<p> In this second semester of Qunatum Mechanics we will broaden our
understanding of the theory, considering techniques that
can lead us to approximate solutions of more complicated 
systems. Application of quantum formalism to descriptions of atomic
systems, solid state systems, nuclei and other subatomic particles
will be presented.  </p>

<p>There are <i>many</i> other textbooks out there, i'm just less
familiar with them. Make sure you have access to at least one that
you're comfortable with. There might be minor notational differences
with respect to the lectures, but that's something we all have to get
used to anyway.</p>
