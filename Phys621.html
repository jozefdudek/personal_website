<h1>Phys621 &mdash; Graduate Quantum Mechanics I</h1>
<br>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Purpose of this course</h3>

<p> Ideally this class will achieve several things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>approach Quantum Mechanics somewhat more rigorously than in your undergraduate classes, using more sophisticated mathematical tools</li>
  <li>build a stronger conceptual understanding — the first time around you might have been preoccupied getting comfortable with the mathematics, such that you missed some of the 'big picture'</li>
  <li>begin to extend into more advanced areas so that you are ready to apply Quantum Mechanics to contemporary research projects</li>
</ul>
<p>I will try to make the course as self-contained as possible, avoiding relying too much on any prior knowledge of Quantum Mechanics you might, or might not, have.
</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Class Schedule</h3>
<p>Mondays and Wednesdays, 9.30am &mdash;
10.50am in Small Hall 122.</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<p>Wednesdays, 1pm &mdash; 2.30pm in Small Hall
328C.</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Lecture Notes</h3>
<p>I’ll post lecture notes on this website as we go along, which will sometimes contain a bit more information than we cover during lecture time. Hopefully this means you can do less writing and be a bit more focussed during lecture time. Please let me know of any errors you spot in the notes.</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Problem Sets</h3>
<p>There will be regular problem sets on the material we cover in lectures. These are a very important part of the course, almost certainly more important than listening to your lecturer waffle on. Sitting through lectures may make you <i>feel</i> like you have learned something, but you don’t really know until you try to use the techniques you think you have learned.</p>

<p>I will try my best to make the problems pedagogic so that you learn something by doing them. You should attempt the problems first on your own, but if you find you can’t solve a problem, you should seek help, either from me, or by collaborating with your classmates. But it is important that what you submit at the end represents <i>your</i> understanding of the problem — simply copying someone else's solution without understanding it is cheating and will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>You should try to present your solutions 'professionally' — they should feature text explaining what each major step in your solution is trying to do, and labelling any prior results you are making use of. I’ll provide my own solutions each week so you can get a better idea of what I mean. You don’t need to use LaTeX or other typesetting (unless you want to), but I do need to be able to read what you submit, so please think about legibility.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that problems sets are not meant primarily as an assessment exercise, and for that reason, relatively little grade-credit is assigned to them. The payoff for putting in the effort comes in the form of learning, and the grade payoff comes when you get high grades in the midterm and the final exam, because you are so well-prepared, and then ace the QM problems on the qualifier.</p>

<p>The problem sets and deadlines are posted below.</p>
