<h1>Phys621 &mdash; Graduate Quantum Mechanics I</h1>
<br>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Purpose of this course</h3>

<p> Ideally this class will achieve several things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>approach Quantum Mechanics somewhat more rigorously than in your undergraduate classes, using more sophisticated mathematical tools</li>
  <li>build a stronger conceptual understanding — the first time around you might have been preoccupied getting comfortable with the mathematics, such that you missed some of the 'big picture'</li>
  <li>begin to extend into more advanced areas so that you are ready to apply Quantum Mechanics to contemporary research projects</li>
</ul>
<p>I will try to make the course as self-contained as possible, avoiding relying too much on any prior knowledge of Quantum Mechanics you might, or might not, have.
</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Class Schedule</h3>
<p>Mondays and Wednesdays, 9.30am &mdash;
10.50am in Small Hall 122.</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<p>Wednesdays, 1pm &mdash; 2.30pm in Small Hall
328C.</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Lecture Notes</h3>
<p>I’ll post lecture notes on this website as we go along, which will sometimes contain a bit more information than we cover during lecture time. Hopefully this means you can do less writing and be a bit more focussed during lecture time. Please let me know of any errors you spot in the notes.</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Problem Sets</h3>
<p>There will be regular problem sets on the material we cover in lectures. These are a very important part of the course, almost certainly more important than listening to your lecturer waffle on. Sitting through lectures may make you <i>feel</i> like you have learned something, but you don’t really know until you try to use the techniques you think you have learned.</p>

<p>I will try my best to make the problems pedagogic so that you learn something by doing them. You should attempt the problems first on your own, but if you find you can’t solve a problem, you should seek help, either from me, or by collaborating with your classmates. But it is important that what you submit at the end represents <i>your</i> understanding of the problem — simply copying someone else's solution without understanding it is cheating and will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>You should try to present your solutions 'professionally' — they should feature text explaining what each major step in your solution is trying to do, and labelling any prior results you are making use of. I’ll provide my own solutions each week so you can get a better idea of what I mean. You don’t need to use LaTeX or other typesetting (unless you want to), but I do need to be able to read what you submit, so please think about legibility.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that problems sets are not meant primarily as an assessment exercise, and for that reason, relatively little grade-credit is assigned to them. The payoff for putting in the effort comes in the form of learning, and the grade payoff comes when you get high grades in the midterm and the final exam, because you are so well-prepared, and then ace the QM problems on the qualifier.</p>

<p>The problem sets and deadlines are posted below.</p>

<h3>Books</h3>
<p>There is no single recommended QM book for this class. If you look you will find that about 99% of physics professors seem to write a QM book at some point during their careers, so there is a huge range to choose from. I’ll just list some of my favorites, with a few comments for each:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sakurai <i>Modern Quantum Mechanics</i>. Newer editions have
  been updated by Jim Napolitano. A nice and relatively short book at
  the graduate level. Clear notation, nice problems, but not a huge
  consideration of 'applications', and relatively little on wave
  equations.</li>
  
  <li>Gottfried &amp; Yan <i>Quantum Mechanics: Fundamentals</i>. Gets through
  the basic material quite quickly, more formal in some places, but
  quite a few nice applications. Assumes more math confidence than
  Sakurai. More typos that you might like, but most of them are listed
  on a website.</li>

  <li>Landau &amp; Lifshitz <i>Quantum Mechanics (Non-relativistic
  theory)</i>. Hardcore, assumes you are a master of mathematics. But
  very thorough, and well written / translated from Russian. Notation
  may take some getting used to.</li>

  <li>Gasiorowicz <i>Quantum Physics</i>. Short book nominally at the
  undergraduate level, but a very nice read. A good start point if
  you've had little QM previously.</li>

  <li>Feynman <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol III</i>. Designed by
  Feynman to be taught to undergraduate freshmen! Not formal at all,
  assumes very little mathematics. Beautifully written, and fun to
  read, but not really a textbook in the usual sense of the word.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are loads of other good books that I just don’t happen to know well, so find one that works for you. Most textbooks will say in the authors' foreword if they are aimed at the graduate level, and generally they all contain the same core topics. I would strongly recommend you do have at least one textbook on hand, and that you read the relevant sections in parallel as we go through the course.</p>


<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Math</h3>
<p> Familiarity with simple linear algebra is a huge help. You will
probably be seeing plenty of this in PHYS603, so I won’t devote a lot
of time to it. Some basic techniques for solving ordinary differential
equations will also come in handy. Some of the more advanced methods
we’ll consider are expressed in terms of complex variables, so some
knowledge of properties of analytic functions and contour integration
is helpful. Again, you'll likely see a lot of this in PHYS603 if you
aren’t already familiar.</p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Topics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Quantum behavior, interference and probability amplitudes &mdash; a pedagogic illustration</li>
  <li>Inferring the "rules" of quantum mechanical amplitudes using a simple experiment</li>
  <li>The mathematical structure of quantum mechanics</li>
  <li>States and probabilities</li>
  <li>Position and momentum</li>
  <li>Time evolution of quantum systems</li>
  <li>The Schroedinger wave equation in one-dimension</li>
  <li>Periodic potentials in one-dimension</li>
  <li>Rotations and angular momentum</li>
  <li>Three dimensional systems</li>
  <li>Coupling to electromagnetism</li>
</ul>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p> Problem Sets: <i>20%</i>, Midterm Exam: <i>30%</i>, Final Exam: <i>50%</i>. </p>

<!-- ============================================== -->
<h3>Next Semester</h3>
<p>There is a second semester of this class in which we'll develop the
theory of quantum mechanics further including topics such as
approximation methods, coupling of angular momentum, scattering in
three dimensions, many particle systems, path integrals, and attempts
at constructing relativistic wave equations. </p>
